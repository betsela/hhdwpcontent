== FAQ ==
Maybe there’s a lot of questions on your mind. See the FAQ on the main website and the setup guide for implementing the seers cookie consent plugin.

= The Cookie Banner is not displaying?

If your banner isn’t showing, please make sure:

1. After you installed and activated the plugin from WordPress, you should also activate it through our wp plugin settings by providing your email address, agreeing to terms and clicking the Activate button.
2. Please be patient. It can take up to 24 hours for the complete scan of your website after activating the plugin.
3. Check whether you have switched the banner toggle off in the plugin settings. (or unchecked the banner checkbox in the Seers Account Dashboard of cookie banner settings)

We hope that you have successfully displayed the banner on your website after following the steps mentioned above.

If you are still unable to see your banner or for any further assistance, please contact us at [support@seersco.com](mailto:support@seersco.com).

= This plugin blocks all the cookies?
Yes, the plugin blocks all the cookies except the ones marked as necessary. If you haven’t switched prior consent ON, then all the cookies will be automatically stored until a user disables those.
